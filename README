A tiny tool I threw together in a couple of minutes at a friend's
request. Reportedly works under HP-UX 11.

Usage:

    ./chktcpport <REMOTE_HOST> <REMOTE_PORT> <TIMEOUT_IN_SECS>

E.g.:

    ./chktcpport github.com 80 5 && echo 'Port open.'

test.sh is an example of using this for scripting. It will test all
the combinations of two hostnames, "github.com" and "localhost", and the
following ports - 21, 22, 25, 80, 81, 443, 7777 and 12345.
